# Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF)

This project implements an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) data assimilation framework designed for state estimation in high-dimensional, nonlinear systems.
Written in C#, it aims to provide an efficient tool for hydrological engineering, environmental monitoring, and other fields requiring real-time or offline state updates.

## Features

* **Efficient State Estimation:** Uses ensemble methods to avoid the expensive covariance matrix storage and inversion typical in classical Kalman filters, suitable for high-dimensional problems.
* **Modular Design:** Core components include state variables, observation information, and parameter settings, making the framework extensible and customizable.
* **Flexible Parameter Configuration:** Supports various parameter settings to fit different application needs.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/miaodaiyu1996/Ensemble-Kalman-Filter.git
   ```

2. Configure your model parameters and observation information in the `Enkf.cs` file or related parameter classes.

3. Call the relevant methods of the `Enkf` class in your main program to run the state estimation.

## Example Usage

```csharp
var enkf = new Enkf();
enkf.Initialize(parameters);
enkf.Run();
```

Make sure to customize the `parameters` object according to your specific application.
